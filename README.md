# Node Typescript

The purpose of this repo is to implement type checking with typescript.  We are not using typescript to transpile our code.  For that we are using the JavaScript standard way of doing it with babel.

Everyone can agree that having types makes a huge improvement to all of our codebases.  Everyone can probably agree that using typescript is super invasive.  You need to change your build tool, your linting (up until recently), your way you include JS features.  Typescript is invasive.  But what if TS only checked types?  It can with the correct configuration.

Using TS for types works great allowing you to use you normal JS workflows everywhere else.
